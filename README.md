# Spotify-Playlist-Data-Analysis-Project

## Overview
This project utilizes the Spotipy library for Spotify API interaction to retrieve track information from a specific playlist. The data is then stored in a Microsoft SQL Server database using SQLAlchemy, and pandas is employed to structure the data in a DataFrame before being stored in the database.
